# Distributed Neural Network Prototype

We are going to use this folder to build a prototype.
After the prototype is completed, we are going to implement it in JAMScript.

To log our procedures and implementation, we are going to use Jupyter Notebook.
I recommend watching this tutorial: [Jupyter Notebook Tutorial: Introduction, Setup, and Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk)

## Development Setup (based on Ubuntu)
1. Install python 3 
```
sudo apt install python3
```
2. Install pip 3
```
sudo apt install python3-pip
```
3. Using pip, install jupyter to use Jupyter notebook.
```
pip3 install jupyter
```
4. To run notebook local server, run command in the directory: jamscript-ml/prototype 
```
jupyter notebook
```
